1. Implement a function named: 𝐨𝐮_𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐨 (𝒑, 𝒒) ≡ (𝑝 ⨁ 𝑞)
2. Implement a function that takes a positive integer and returns a
list with the respective prime factors.
3. Implement a function 𝒇(𝒏; 𝒃) that, using Euclid's algorithm
expanded, return, if any, the inverse multiplicative of b modulo n. Case
does not exist, the function must present the greatest common divisor of the two
numbers.
The numbers n and b must be positive integers such that 𝒃 ≤ 𝒏. Case
this condition is not verified, the function should issue a message allusive
to error
The numbers n and b must be requested from the user at the beginning of each execution of the
program and this should only end when the user orders it.
The formatting of the function's output should be similar to that shown in the
following image:
